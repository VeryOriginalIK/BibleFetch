1 Samuel 2:1-10,1Samuel 2:1-10,"And Hannah, in prayer before the Lord, said, My heart is glad in the Lord, my horn is lifted up in the Lord: my mouth is open wide over my haters; because my joy is in your salvation.No other is holy as the Lord, for there is no other God but you: there is no Rock like our God.Say no more words of pride; let not uncontrolled sayings come out of your mouths: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, by him acts are judged.The bows of the men of war are broken, and the feeble are clothed with strength.Those who were full are offering themselves as servants for bread; those who were in need are at rest; truly, she who had no children has become the mother of seven; and she who had a family is wasted with sorrow.The Lord is the giver of death and life: sending men down to the underworld and lifting them up.The Lord gives wealth and takes a man's goods from him: crushing men down and again lifting them up;Lifting the poor out of the dust, and him who is in need out of the lowest place, to give them their place among rulers, and for their heritage the seat of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's and he has made them the base of the world.He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the evil-doers will come to their end in the dark night, for by strength no man will overcome.Those who make war against the Lord will be broken; against them he will send his thunder from heaven: the Lord will be judge of the ends of the earth, he will give strength to his king, lifting up the horn of him on whom the holy oil has been put.","Hannah prayed, and said:
“My heart exults in Yahweh!
My horn is exalted in Yahweh.
My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,
because I rejoice in your salvation.
There is no one as holy as Yahweh,
For there is no one besides you,
nor is there any rock like our God.
“Don’t keep talking so exceedingly proudly.
Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth,
For Yahweh is a God of knowledge.
By him actions are weighed.
“The bows of the mighty men are broken.
Those who stumbled are armed with strength.
Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread.
Those who were hungry are satisfied.
Yes, the barren has borne seven.
She who has many children languishes.
“Yahweh kills, and makes alive.
He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.
Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich.
He brings low, he also lifts up.
He raises up the poor out of the dust.
He lifts up the needy from the dunghill,
To make them sit with princes,
and inherit the throne of glory.
For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh’s.
He has set the world on them.
He will keep the feet of his holy ones,
but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness;
for no man shall prevail by strength.
Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces.
He will thunder against them in the sky.
“Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth.
He will give strength to his king,
and exalt the horn of his anointed.”",
2 Samuel 22:2-51,2Samuel 22:2-51,"And he said, The Lord is my Rock, my walled town, and my saviour, even mine;My God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my safe place; my saviour, who keeps me safe from the violent man.I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me.For the waves of death came round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear;The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me.In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came to his ears.Then the earth was moved with a violent shock; the bases of heaven were moved and shaking, because he was angry.There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: coals were lighted by it.The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his feet.And he went through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind.And he made the dark his tent round him, a mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies.Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and coals of fire.The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out.And he sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled.Then the deep beds of the sea were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of the Lord's wrath, because of the breath of his mouth.He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters.He made me free from my strong hater, from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I.They came on me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my support.He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me.The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him.For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my God.For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me.And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin.Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes.On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright;He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge.For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but your eyes are on men of pride, to make them low.For you are my light, O Lord; and the Lord will make the dark bright for me.By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in: by the help of my God I have gone over a wall.As for God, his way is all good: the word of the Lord is tested; he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him.For who is God but the Lord? and who is a Rock but our God?God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way.He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places.He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms.You have given me the breastplate of your salvation, and your mercy has made me great.You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet make no slip.I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome.I have sent destruction on them and given them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are stretched under my feet.For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who came out against me.By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off.They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer.Then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth, stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets.You have made me free from the fightings of my people; you have made me the head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants.Men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority: from the time when my name comes to their ears, they will be ruled by me.They will be wasted away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear.The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured:It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule.He makes me free from my haters: I am lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from the violent man.Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name.Great salvation does he give to his king; he has mercy on the king of his selection, David, and on his seed for ever.","and he said:
“Yahweh is my rock,
my fortress,
and my deliverer, even mine;
God is my rock in whom I take refuge;
my shield, and the horn of my salvation,
my high tower, and my refuge.
My savior, you save me from violence.
I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised;
So shall I be saved from my enemies.
For the waves of death surrounded me.
The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
The cords of Sheol were around me.
The snares of death caught me.
In my distress, I called on Yahweh.
Yes, I called to my God.
He heard my voice out of his temple.
My cry came into his ears.
Then the earth shook and trembled.
The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken,
because he was angry.
Smoke went up out of his nostrils.
Consuming fire came out of his mouth.
Coals were kindled by it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down.
Thick darkness was under his feet.
He rode on a cherub, and flew.
Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.
He made darkness a shelter around himself:
gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
At the brightness before him,
coals of fire were kindled.
Yahweh thundered from heaven.
The Most High uttered his voice.
He sent out arrows, and scattered them;
lightning, and confused them.
Then the channels of the sea appeared.
The foundations of the world were laid bare by Yahweh’s rebuke,
at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
He sent from on high and he took me.
He drew me out of many waters.
He delivered me from my strong enemy,
from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
They came on me in the day of my calamity,
but Yahweh was my support.
He also brought me out into a large place.
He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness.
He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
For I have kept Yahweh’s ways,
and have not wickedly departed from my God.
For all his ordinances were before me.
As for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
I was also perfect toward him.
I kept myself from my iniquity.
Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.
With the pure you will show yourself pure.
With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
You will save the afflicted people,
But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.
For you are my lamp, Yahweh.
Yahweh will light up my darkness.
For by you, I run against a troop.
By my God, I leap over a wall.
As for God, his way is perfect.
Yahweh’s word is tested.
He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
For who is God, besides Yahweh?
Who is a rock, besides our God?
God is my strong fortress.
He makes my way perfect.
He makes his feet like hinds’ feet,
and sets me on my high places.
He teaches my hands to war,
so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
Your gentleness has made me great.
You have enlarged my steps under me.
My feet have not slipped.
I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them.
I didn’t turn again until they were consumed.
I have consumed them,
and struck them through,
so that they can’t arise.
Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
For you have armed me with strength for the battle.
You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,
that I might cut off those who hate me.
They looked, but there was no one to save;
even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.
Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.
I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people.
You have kept me to be the head of the nations.
A people whom I have not known will serve me.
The foreigners will submit themselves to me.
As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.
The foreigners will fade away,
and will come trembling out of their close places.
Yahweh lives!
Blessed be my rock!
Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
even the God who executes vengeance for me,
who brings down peoples under me,
who brings me away from my enemies.
Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.
You deliver me from the violent man.
Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations,
and will sing praises to your name.
He gives great deliverance to his king,
and shows loving kindness to his anointed,
to David and to his offspring, forever more.”",
2 Samuel 23:5,2Samuel23:5,"For is not my house so with God? For he has made with me an eternal agreement, ordered in all things and certain: as for all my salvation and all my desire, will he not give it increase?","Isn’t my house so with God?
Yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant,
ordered in all things, and sure,
for it is all my salvation, and all my desire,
although he doesn’t make it grow.",

Of the servant of the Lord, of David, who said the words of this song to the Lord on the day when the Lord made him free from the hand of all his haters, and from the hand of Saul; and he said,> I will give you my love, O Lord, my strength.The Lord is my Rock, my walled town, and my saviour; my God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me.The cords of death were round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear.The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me.In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came before him, even into his ears.Then trouble and shock came on the earth; and the bases of the mountains were moved and shaking, because he was angry.There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: flames were lighted by it.The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his feet.And he went in flight through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind.He made the dark his secret place; his tent round him was the dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and fire.The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out: a rain of ice and fire.He sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled.Then the deep beds of the waters were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of your words of wrath, O Lord, because of the breath from your mouth.He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters.He made me free from my strong hater, and from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I.They came on me in the day of my trouble; but the Lord was my support.He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me.The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him.For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my God.For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me.And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin.Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes.On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright;He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge.For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but eyes full of pride will be made low.You, O Lord, will be my light; by you, my God, the dark will be made bright for me.By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in; by the help of my God I have gone over a wall.As for God, his way is completely good; the word of the Lord is tested; he is a breastplate for all those who put their faith in him.For who is God but the Lord? or who is a Rock but our God?God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way.He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places.He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms.You have given me the breastplate of your salvation: your right hand has been my support, and your mercy has made me great.You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet are kept from slipping.I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome.I will give them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are stretched under my feet.For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who come out against me.By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off.They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer.Then they were crushed as small as dust before the wind; they were drained out like the waste of the streets.You have made me free from the fightings of the people; you have made me the head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants.From the time when my name comes to their ears they will be ruled by me: men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority.They will be wasting away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear.The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured.It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule.He makes me free from my haters; I am lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from the violent man.Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name.Great salvation does he give to his king; he has mercy on the king of his selection, David, and on his seed for ever.","I love you, Yahweh, my strength.
Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;
my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;
my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised;
and I am saved from my enemies.
The cords of death surrounded me.
The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
The cords of Sheol were around me.
The snares of death came on me.
In my distress I called on Yahweh,
and cried to my God.
He heard my voice out of his temple.
My cry before him came into his ears.
Then the earth shook and trembled.
The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,
because he was angry.
Smoke went out of his nostrils.
Consuming fire came out of his mouth.
Coals were kindled by it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down.
Thick darkness was under his feet.
He rode on a cherub, and flew.
Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.
He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,
darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,
hailstones and coals of fire.
Yahweh also thundered in the sky.
The Most High uttered his voice:
hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them;
Yes, great lightning bolts, and routed them.
Then the channels of waters appeared.
The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh,
at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
He sent from on high.
He took me.
He drew me out of many waters.
He delivered me from my strong enemy,
from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
They came on me in the day of my calamity,
but Yahweh was my support.
He brought me out also into a large place.
He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness.
According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
For I have kept the ways of Yahweh,
and have not wickedly departed from my God.
For all his ordinances were before me.
I didn’t put away his statutes from me.
I was also blameless with him.
I kept myself from my iniquity.
Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.
With the pure, you will show yourself pure.
With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
For you will save the afflicted people,
but the haughty eyes you will bring down.
For you will light my lamp, Yahweh.
My God will light up my darkness.
For by you, I advance through a troop.
By my God, I leap over a wall.
As for God, his way is perfect.
Yahweh’s word is tried.
He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
For who is God, except Yahweh?
Who is a rock, besides our God,
the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?
He makes my feet like deer’s feet,
and sets me on my high places.
He teaches my hands to war,
so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
Your right hand sustains me.
Your gentleness has made me great.
You have enlarged my steps under me,
My feet have not slipped.
I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.
Neither will I turn again until they are consumed.
I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.
They shall fall under my feet.
For you have armed me with strength to the battle.
You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,
that I might cut off those who hate me.
They cried, but there was no one to save;
even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.
Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.
I cast them out as the mire of the streets.
You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.
You have made me the head of the nations.
A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.
The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.
The foreigners shall fade away,
and shall come trembling out of their close places.
Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock.
Exalted be the God of my salvation,
even the God who executes vengeance for me,
and subdues peoples under me.
He rescues me from my enemies.
Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.
You deliver me from the violent man.
Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations,
and will sing praises to your name.
He gives great deliverance to his king,
and shows loving kindness to his anointed,
to David and to his offspring, forever more.",
Psalm 20:6,Psalm20:6,Now am I certain that the Lord gives salvation to his king; he will give him an answer from his holy heaven with the strength of salvation in his right hand.,"Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed.

with the saving strength of his right hand.",

Neither has he hidden his face from him;
but when he cried to him, he heard.",
Psalm 30:1-3,Psalm30:1-3,"<A Psalm. A Song at the blessing of the House. Of David.> I will give you praise and honour, O Lord, because through you I have been lifted up; you have not given my haters cause to be glad over me.O Lord my God, I sent up my cry to you, and you have made me well.O Lord, you have made my soul come again from the underworld: you have given me life and kept me from going down among the dead.","I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up,
and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.
Yahweh my God, I cried to you,
and you have healed me.
Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.
You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.",

and delivered me from all my fears.

He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
Yahweh helps them, and rescues them.
He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them,
Because they have taken refuge in him.",
Psalm 40:1-3,Psalm40:1-3,"<To the chief music-maker. Of David. A Psalm.> When I was waiting quietly for the Lord, his heart was turned to me, and he gave ear to my cry.He took me up out of a deep waste place, out of the soft and sticky earth; he put my feet on a rock, and made my steps certain.And he put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God; numbers have seen it with fear, and put their faith in the Lord.","I waited patiently for Yahweh.
He turned to me, and heard my cry.
He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,
out of the miry clay.
He set my feet on a rock,
and gave me a firm place to stand.
He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.
Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.",

although there are many who oppose me.",

that I may walk before God in the light of the living.",

I will declare what he has done for my soul.

You have held my right hand.
You will guide me with your counsel,

so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.

They sang his praise.",
Psalm Psalm 107,PsalmPsalm 107,"O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.Let those whose cause the Lord has taken up say so, his people whom he has taken out of the hands of their haters;Making them come together out of all the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.They were wandering in the waste places; they saw no way to a resting-place.Their souls became feeble for need of food and drink.Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles;Guiding them in the right way, so that they might come into the town of their resting-place.Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!He gives its desire to the unresting soul, so that it is full of good things.Those who were in the dark, in the black night, in chains of sorrow and iron;Because they went against the words of God, and gave no thought to the laws of the Most High:So that he made their hearts weighted down with grief; they were falling, and had no helper.Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles.He took them out of the dark and the black night, and all their chains were broken.Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!The doors of brass are broken by his arm, and the bands of iron are cut in two.Foolish men, because of their sins, and because of their wrongdoing, are troubled;They are disgusted by all food, and they come near to the doors of death.Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles.He sent his word and made them well, and kept them safe from the underworld.Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!Let them make offerings of praise, giving news of his works with cries of joy.Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in the great waters;They see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.For at his word comes up the storm-wind, lifting high the waves.The sailors go up to heaven, and down into the deep; their souls are wasted because of their trouble.They are turned here and there, rolling like a man who is full of wine; and all their wisdom comes to nothing.Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles.He makes the storm into a calm, so that the waves are at peace.Then they are glad, because the sea is quiet, and he takes them to the harbour of their desire.Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!Let them give glory to him in the meeting of the people, and praise among the chiefs.He makes rivers into waste places, and springs of water into a dry land;He makes a fertile country into a salt waste, because of the sins of those who are living there.He makes a waste land into a place of water, and a dry land into water-springs.And there he gives the poor a resting-place, so that they may make themselves a town;And put seed in the fields and make vine-gardens, to give them fruit.He gives them his blessing so that they are increased greatly, and their cattle do not become less.And when they are made low, and crushed by trouble and sorrow,He puts an end to the pride of kings, and sends them wandering in the waste lands where there is no way.But he puts the poor man on high from his troubles, and gives him families like a flock.The upright see it and are glad: the mouth of the sinner is stopped.Let the wise give thought to these things, and see the mercies of the Lord.","Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
for his loving kindness endures forever.
Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so,
whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
And gathered out of the lands,
from the east and from the west,
from the north and from the south.
They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.
They found no city to live in.
Hungry and thirsty,
their soul fainted in them.
Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,
and he delivered them out of their distresses,
he led them also by a straight way,
that they might go to a city to live in.
Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,
for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
For he satisfies the longing soul.
He fills the hungry soul with good.
Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
being bound in affliction and iron,
because they rebelled against the words of God,
and condemned the counsel of the Most High.
Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.
They fell down, and there was no one to help.
Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,
and he saved them out of their distresses.
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
and broke away their chains.
Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,
for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
For he has broken the gates of brass,
and cut through bars of iron.
Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,
and because of their iniquities.
Their soul abhors all kinds of food.
They draw near to the gates of death.
Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,
he saves them out of their distresses.
He sends his word, and heals them,
and delivers them from their graves.
Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,
for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
and declare his deeds with singing.
Those who go down to the sea in ships,
who do business in great waters;
These see Yahweh’s deeds,
and his wonders in the deep.
For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,
which lifts up its waves.
They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.
Their soul melts away because of trouble.
They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,
and are at their wits’ end.
Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,
and he brings them out of their distress.
He makes the storm a calm,
so that its waves are still.
Then they are glad because it is calm,
so he brings them to their desired haven.
Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness,
for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!
Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
and praise him in the seat of the elders.
He turns rivers into a desert,
water springs into a thirsty ground,
and a fruitful land into a salt waste,
for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
He turns a desert into a pool of water,
and a dry land into water springs.
There he makes the hungry live,
that they may prepare a city to live in,
sow fields, plant vineyards,
and reap the fruits of increase.
He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.
He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease.
Again, they are diminished and bowed down
through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
He pours contempt on princes,
and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.
Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,
and increases their families like a flock.
The upright will see it, and be glad.
All the wicked will shut their mouths.
Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.
They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.",

your loving kindness, Yahweh, endures forever.
Don’t forsake the works of your own hands.",

Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.”
Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation.
In that day you will say, “Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted!
Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth!
Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is great among you!”",

Romans 5:1-11,Romans5:1-11,"For which reason, because we have righteousness through faith, let us be at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;Through whom, in the same way, we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are; and let us have joy in hope of the glory of God.And not only so, but let us have joy in our troubles: in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting;And waiting gives experience; and experience, hope:And hope does not put to shame; because our hearts are full of the love of God through the Holy Spirit which is given to us.For when we were still without strength, at the right time Christ gave his life for evil-doers.Now it is hard for anyone to give his life even for an upright man, though it might be that for a good man someone would give his life.But God has made clear his love to us, in that, when we were still sinners, Christ gave his life for us.Much more, if we now have righteousness by his blood, will salvation from the wrath of God come to us through him.For if, when we were haters of God, the death of his Son made us at peace with him, much more, now that we are his friends, will we have salvation through his life;And not only so, but we have joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we are now at peace with God.","Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance;
and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:
and hope doesn’t disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
For one will hardly die for a righteous man. Yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die.
But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God’s wrath through him.
For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.
Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.","Having been declared righteous, then, by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ,through whom also we have the access by the faith into this grace in which we have stood, and we boast on the hope of the glory of God.And not only so, but we also boast in the tribulations, knowing that the tribulation does work endurance;and the endurance, experience; and the experience, hope;and the hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God has been poured forth in our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.For in our being still ailing, Christ in due time did die for the impious;for scarcely for a righteous man will any one die, for the good man perhaps some one also does dare to die;and God does commend His own love to us, that, in our being still sinners, Christ did die for us;much more, then, having been declared righteous now in his blood, we shall be saved through him from the wrath;for if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in his life.And not only so, but we are also boasting in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we did receive the reconciliation;"
Romans 6:17-23,Romans6:17-23,"But praise be to God that though you were the servants of sin, you have now given yourselves freely to that form of teaching under which you were placed;And being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness.I am using words in the way of men, because your flesh is feeble: as you gave your bodies as servants to what is unclean, and to evil to do evil, so now give them as servants to righteousness to do what is holy.When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness.What fruit had you at that time in the things which are now a shame to you? for the end of such things is death.But now, being free from sin, and having been made servants to God, you have your fruit in that which is holy, and the end is eternal life.For the reward of sin is death; but what God freely gives is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.","But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were delivered.
Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness.
I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification.
For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life.
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.","and thanks to God, that you were servants of the sin, and -- were obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were delivered up;and having been freed from the sin, you became servants to the righteousness.In the manner of men I speak, because of the weakness of your flesh, for even as you did present your members servants to the uncleanness and to the lawlessness -- to the lawlessness, so now present your members servants to the righteousness -- to sanctification,for when you were servants of the sin, you were free from the righteousness,what fruit, therefore, were you having then, in the things of which you are now ashamed? for the end of those is death.And now, having been freed from the sin, and having become servants to God, you have your fruit -- to sanctification, and the end life age-during;for the wages of the sin is death, and the gift of God is life age-during in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans 8:1-4,Romans8:1-4,"For this cause those who are in Christ Jesus will not be judged as sinners.For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.For what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh, God, sending his Son in the image of the evil flesh, and as an offering for sin, gave his decision against sin in the flesh:So that what was ordered by the law might be done in us, who are living, not in the way of the flesh, but in the way of the Spirit.","There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don’t walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.
For what the law couldn’t do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;
that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.","There is, then, now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit;for the law of the Spirit of the life in Christ Jesus did set me free from the law of the sin and of the death;for what the law was not able to do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, His own Son having sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, did condemn the sin in the flesh,that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."
Romans 10:9-13,Romans10:9-13,"Because, if you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and have faith in your heart that God has made him come back from the dead, you will have salvation:For with the heart man has faith to get righteousness, and with the mouth he says that Jesus is Lord to get salvation.Because it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed.And the Jew is not different from the Greek: for there is the same Lord of all, who is good to all who have hope in his name:Because, Whoever will give worship to the name of the Lord will get salvation.","that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.
For, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”","that if you may confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and may believe in your heart that God did raise him out of the dead, you shall be saved,for with the heart does one believe to righteousness, and with the mouth is confession made to salvation;for the Writing says, 'Every one who is believing on him shall not be ashamed,'for there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all is rich to all those calling upon Him,for every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.'"

and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
For most certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he gives help to the offspring of Abraham.
Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.
For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.","Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death -- that is, the devil --and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,for, doubtless, of messengers it does not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it lays hold,therefore it did behoove him in all things to be made like to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people,for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."

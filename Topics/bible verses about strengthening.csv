Acts Acts 2,ActsActs 2,"And when the day of Pentecost was come, they were all together in one place.And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind, and all the house where they were was full of it.And they saw tongues, like flames of fire, coming to rest on every one of them.And they were all full of the Holy Spirit, and were talking in different languages, as the Spirit gave them power.Now there were living at Jerusalem, Jews, God-fearing men, from every nation under heaven.And when this sound came to their ears, they all came together, and were greatly surprised because every man was hearing the words of the disciples in his special language.And they were full of wonder and said, Are not all these men Galilaeans?And how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth?Men of Parthia, Media, and Elam, and those living in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,In Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and those who have come from Rome, Jews by birth and others who have become Jews,Men of Crete and Arabia, to all of us they are talking in our different languages, of the great works of God.And they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another, What is the reason of this?But others, making sport of them, said, They are full of new wine.But Peter, getting up, with the eleven, said in a loud voice, O men of Judaea, and all you who are living in Jerusalem, take note of this and give ear to my words.For these men are not overcome with wine, as it seems to you, for it is only the third hour of the day;But this is the thing which was said by the prophet Joel;And it will come about, in the last days, says God, that I will send out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams:And on my men-servants and my women-servants I will send my Spirit, and they will be prophets.And wonders will be seen in heaven, and signs on the earth, blood and fire and smoke:The sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood, before that great day of the Lord comes in glory:And whoever makes his prayer to the Lord will have salvation.Men of Israel, give ear to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man who had the approval of God, as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which God did by him among you, as you yourselves have knowledge,Him, when he was given up, by the decision and knowledge of God, you put to death on the cross, by the hands of evil men:But God gave him back to life, having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it.For David said of him, I saw the Lord before my face at all times, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved:And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy, and my flesh will be resting in hope:For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction.You have made me see the ways of life; I will be full of joy when I see your face.My brothers, I may say to you openly that David came to his death, and was put in the earth, and his resting-place is with us today.But being a prophet, and having in mind the oath which God had given to him, that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king,He, having knowledge of the future, was talking of the coming again of Christ from the dead, that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction.This Jesus God has given back to life, of which we all are witnesses.And so, being lifted up to the right hand of God, and having the Father's word that the Holy Spirit would come, he has sent this thing, which now you see and have knowledge of.For David has not gone up into heaven, but says, himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand,Till I put all those who are against you under your feet.For this reason, let all Israel be certain that this Jesus, whom you put to death on the cross, God has made Lord and Christ.Now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled, and they said to Peter and the other Apostles, Brothers, what are we to do?And Peter said, Let your hearts be changed, every one of you, and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you.For the word of God is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off, even all those who may be marked out by the Lord our God.And with more such words he gave his witness, offering them salvation and saying, Come out from this evil generation.Then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism: and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day.And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles' teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer.But fear came on every soul: and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the Apostles.And all those who were of the faith kept together, and had all things in common;And exchanging their goods and property for money, they made division of it among them all, as they had need.And day by day, going in agreement together regularly to the Temple and, taking broken bread together in their houses, they took their food with joy and with true hearts,Giving praise to God, and having the approval of all the people; and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the Lord.","Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place.
Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them.
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.
Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky.
When this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language.
They were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, “Behold, aren’t all these who speak Galileans?
How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?
Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Cretans and Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God!”
They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?”
Others, mocking, said, “They are filled with new wine.”
But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, “You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.
For these aren’t drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day.
But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel:
‘It will be in the last days, says God,
that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.
Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
Your young men will see visions.
Your old men will dream dreams.
Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days,
I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
I will show wonders in the sky above,
and signs on the earth beneath;
blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.
The sun will be turned into darkness,
and the moon into blood,
before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.
It will be that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.’
“Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him among you, even as you yourselves know,
him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;
whom God raised up, having freed him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
For David says concerning him,
‘I saw the Lord always before my face,
For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.
Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;
because you will not leave my soul in Hades,
neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.
You made known to me the ways of life.
You will make me full of gladness with your presence.’
“Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,
he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul wasn’t left in Hades, and his flesh didn’t see decay.
This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.
Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.
For David didn’t ascend into the heavens, but he says himself,
‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit by my right hand,
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’
“Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.”
With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation!”
Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.
They continued steadfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer.
Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.
All who believed were together, and had all things in common.
They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.
Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
praising God, and having favor with all the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.","And in the day of the Pentecost being fulfilled, they were all with one accord at the same place,and there came suddenly out of the heaven a sound as of a bearing violent breath, and it filled all the house where they were sitting,and there appeared to them divided tongues, as it were of fire; it sat also upon each one of them,and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, according as the Spirit was giving them to declare.And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation of those under the heaven,and the rumour of this having come, the multitude came together, and was confounded, because they were each one hearing them speaking in his proper dialect,and they were all amazed, and did wonder, saying one unto another, 'Lo, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?and how do we hear, each in our proper dialect, in which we were born?Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, in Judea also, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,Phrygia also, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya, that are along Cyrene, and the strangers of Rome, both Jews and proselytes,Cretes and Arabians, we did hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.'And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one unto another, 'What would this wish to be?'and others mocking said, -- 'They are full of sweet wine;'and Peter having stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and declared to them, 'Men, Jews! and all those dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and hearken to my sayings,for these are not drunken, as you take it up, for it is the third hour of the day.'But this is that which has been spoken through the prophet Joel:And it shall be in the last days, said God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;and also upon My men-servants, and upon My maid-servants, in those days, I will pour out of My Spirit, and they shall prophesy;and I will give wonders in the heaven above, and signs upon the earth beneath -- blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke,the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the day of the Lord -- the great and illustrious;and it shall be, every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.'Men, Israelites! hear these words, Jesus the Nazarene, a man approved of God among you by mighty works, and wonders, and signs, that God did through him in the midst of you, according as also you yourselves have known;this one, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, being given out, having taken by lawless hands, having crucified -- you did slay;whom God did raise up, having loosed the pains of the death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it,for David said in regard to him: I foresaw the Lord always before me -- because He is on my right hand -- that I may not be moved;because of this was my heart cheered, and my tongue was glad, and yet -- my flesh also shall rest on hope,because You will not leave my soul to hades, nor will You give Your Kind One to see corruption;You did make known to me ways of life, You shall fill me with joy with Your countenance.'Men, brethren! it is permitted to speak with freedom unto you concerning the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is among us unto this day;a prophet, therefore, being, and knowing that with an oath God did swear to him, out of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up the Christ, to sit upon his throne,having foreseen, he did speak concerning the rising again of the Christ, that his soul was not left to hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.'This Jesus did God raise up, of which we are all witnesses;at the right hand then of God having been exalted -- also the promise of the Holy Spirit having received from the Father -- he was shedding forth this, which now you see and hear;for David did not go up to the heavens, and he said himself: The Lord said to my lord, Sit you at my right hand,till I make your foes your footstool;assuredly, therefore, let all the house of Israel know, that both Lord and Christ did God make him -- this Jesus whom you did crucify.'And having heard, they were pricked to the heart; they say also to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, 'What shall we do, men, brethren?'and Peter said unto them, 'Reform, and be baptized each of you on the name of Jesus Christ, to remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,for to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.'Also with many more other words he was testifying and exhorting, saying, 'Be saved from this perverse generation;'then those, indeed, who did gladly receive his word were baptized, and there were added on that day, as it were, three thousand souls,and they were continuing stedfastly in the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of the bread, and the prayers.And fear came on every soul, many wonders also and signs were being done through the apostles,and all those believing were at the same place, and had all things common,and the possessions and the goods they were selling, and were parting them to all, according as any one had need.Daily also continuing with one accord in the temple, breaking also at every house bread, they were partaking of food in gladness and simplicity of heart,praising God, and having favour with all the people, and the Lord was adding those being saved every day to the assembly."

I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,

“Why do you think evil in your hearts?


For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk?’


But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins-” (then he said to the paralytic),
“Get up, and take up your mat, and go to your house.”
